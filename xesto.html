				<p>I am a proficient systems thinker and I enjoy mapping out concepts, theories and the relationships between technologies and trends. These technologies often manifest as signals of upcoming trends. By maintaining this practice as new signals and trends arise, I hope to develop comprehensive maps of innovation and human behaviour.<br><br>
				The above maps are on Data as Material, "A Culture of Moments" (Alexander Manu, <i>Transforming Organizations for the Subscription Economy: Starting from Scratch</i> Routledge, 2017) and The Opt-In future.<br><br>
				Data as Material is the idea of data creation and collection serving as the basis of design and business activity today. Users produce and consume data which leads to the production and consumption of more data. This has reshaped business model design and creates new opprtunities for networks, services and experience optimization.</p>
