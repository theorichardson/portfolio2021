			</div>

			<div class="sectionRight">
				<p>The Xesto app relies on the FaceID camera in iPhones X and up for TrueDepth scanning, therefore a constraint baked into the app is that the scanning process takes place with the phone screen facing away from the user.<br><br>

				This had caused users a lot of trouble since Xesto had begun working on the scanning technology years prior.<br><br>

				The first step in addressing this pain point was a redesign of the instructions first presented to the user. The instructions helped myself and the engineering team map out the experience journey for users, examining each step in the scanning process.</p>

			<p><strong>Purpose:</strong><br>Check feasability of scanning interface with users through testing then implement feedback.<br><br><strong>Feedback:</strong><br> Viewfinding is harder than we thought it would be, the learning curve is steep.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="sectionRight">
				<p>We tested 3 different scanning user interfaces with 10 users who had never been exposed to Xesto Fit before. We got strong feedback that the "target" method of lining the camera up with an image of a foot was far too difficult, though multiple users had suggested it at an earlier stage.<br><br>We realized that while our first UI was too open ended, the target method was too restrictive. We asked <strong>"How can the app hold the user's hand throughout the scanning process?"</strong> and paid attention to how we would explain scanning when we intervened in unsuccessful user testing. This led us to the idea of a guided UI wherein Xesto checks in with the user throughout the scanning process.</p>

			<p><strong>Payoff:</strong><br>Guided UI led to a large increase in successful first time foot scans.	
			</div>

			<div class="sectionRight">
				<p>With the guided UI, approximately 80% of users took successful scans on their first try during our last round of testing. The key to this UI was pauses between each photograph that require the user's manual approval. "Does your photo look like this?" and a visual cue reduced error by a large margin.<br><br>This process taught me and the team a valuable lesson about clarity and communication through a UI. Running successful user testing took practice for myself and the engineers, especially when the team was so used to the mechanics of the app.<br><br>
				I then went about designing the interface to display and interact with the scans and resulting sizing information.</p>

		</div>

			<div class="sectionRight">
				<p>We wanted the scans page to be simple and playful. I experimented with different layouts out hierarchies of information. For example, the 3D foot scans are distinctive and engaging to manipulate but the sizing information they produce is more mission critical. We had to make decisons about our priorities and the priorities of the user, factoring in when and how we thought they would be using our app.<br><br>

				The interface design phase also served to narrow our focus for launch. When I joined the team at Xesto, the engineers were working on scanning a variety of body parts for different purposes. Throughout the design of the interface we discussed the founders' vision for the company and the best use of the technology the team had been working on.<br><br>  

				The foot scanning tech was the most polished and we believed it would be most beneficial to users. We landed on an interface with buttons for each funtion that the user can toggle in and out of, leaving the majority of the screen free to display the foot scans.</p>

			<div class="sectionRight">
				<p>The buttons on the final UI toggle the left and right foot scans, in and out of photogaphic mode and into a technical sizing information screen. This method allows for a large amount of information to be hidden within a simple interface while proving fun to click in and out of.</p>
			</div>

<div class="highlights2">
	<p>My time at Xesto has taught me a great deal about user-centered design and designing for successful outcomes. The constraints of the UX were clear due to the app's dependance the front facing camera for scanning. Only once we had tested, iterated and tested again did we achieve results that were within our target success rate. I learned about asking the right questions and observing users at work. Only when we framed the question as "How can the app hold the user's hand throughout the scanning process?" did we achieve the desired results.<br><br>I am proud of the work that I did at Xesto and am currently on a hiatus from the company to focus on my studies.</p>
