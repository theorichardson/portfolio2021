				<p>With these maps I first sought to contextualize Twitch as a behaviour platform for what I call 'social gaming'. When placed on a timeline and a map of cause and effect signals, it becomes clear that Twitch is the latest manifestation of the practice of watching other people play games for entertainment. This behaviour has been common in sports for thousands of years but became prevalant in gaming with the rise of the arcade as a social hub. Entertainment at the arcade came in the form of playing games oneself as well as watching others play. Local legends were born of leaderboards stacked with anonymous usernames. As I argue in the insights section above, Twitch is a lot like the arcade of the golden era in a number of ways.<br><br>Popular games demanded the most attention from viewers in the arcade, as they do on Twitch today. Games were even designed with the arcade in mind the way free-to-play multiplayer games have taken off in recent years in hopes of going viral.<br><br>The arcade was exciting and skilled gamers were celebrated and revered the way streamers are today. This excitement is something Twitch thrives on due to the live nature of the platform.<br><br>Viewers were inspired the feats of skilled arcade gamers, the same way Twitch viewers sit in awe of Bugha's building in Fortnite. Though I can't perform as well behind the sticks as streamers can, it is thrilling to live vicariously through them, rooting for the win.<br><br>


				With these insights in mind, I did an environmental scan of features and trends in contemporary behaviour platforms. I applied these trends to Twitch while addressing some of Twitch's unique challenges and opportunities. The concepts I generated are listed on the last slide above.</p>

				<p><!--I am a proficient systems thinker and I enjoy mapping out concepts, theories and the relationships between technologies and trends. These technologies often manifest as signals of upcoming trends. By maintaining this practice as new signals and trends arise, I hope to develop comprehensive maps of innovation and human behaviour.<br><br>-->
				The above maps are on Data as Material, "A Culture of Moments" (Alexander Manu, <i>Transforming Organizations for the Subscription Economy: Starting from Scratch</i> Routledge, 2017) and my concept, The Opt-In Future.<br><br>
				<strong>Data as Material</strong> is the idea of data creation and collection serving as the basis of design and business activity today. Users produce and consume data which leads to the production and consumption of more data. This has reshaped business model design and creates new opprtunities for networks, services and experience optimization.<br><br>
				Data as Material produces <strong>A Culture of Moments</strong>. DaM reinvented conventional value propositions by putting the value delivery at the center of the experience. These new forms of value delivery are usually seamless and quick and they create ecosystems like the sharing and streaming economies and XaaS.<br><br>
				DaM and A Culture of Moments in tandem with the automation and augmentation of tasks is shaping <strong>the Opt-In Future</strong>, a future wherein humanity is freed from mundane tasks and able to focus on human pursuits. Automation and augmentation in the home and workplace already save us time and the Opt-In Future is all about who we will become during the time saved.
