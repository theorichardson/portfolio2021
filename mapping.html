			<p><strong>Mapping:</strong> Systems thinking, insight, foresight, signal mapping & trend mapping.</p>	
			</div>

			<div class="sectionRight">
				<p>I am a proficient systems thinker and I enjoy mapping out concepts, theories and the relationships between technologies and trends. These technologies often manifest as signals of upcoming trends. By maintaining this practice as new signals and trends arise, I hope to develop comprehensive maps of innovation and human behaviour.<br><br>
				The above maps are on Data as Material, "A Culture of Moments" (Alexander Manu, <i>Transforming Organizations for the Subscription Economy: Starting from Scratch</i> Routledge, 2017) and The Opt-In future.<br><br>
				Data as Material is the idea of data creation and collection serving as the basis of design and business activity today. Users produce and consume data which leads to the production and consumption of more data. This has reshaped business model design and creates new opprtunities for networks, services and experience optimization.<br><br>
				Data as Material produces a culture of moments. DaM reinvented conventional value propositions by putting the value delivery at the center of the experience. These new forms of value delivery are usually seamless and quick and they create ecosystems like the sharing and streaming economies and XaaS.<br><br>
				DaM and A Culture of Moments in tandem with the automation and augmentation of tasks is shaping the Opt-In Future , a future wherein humanity is freed from mundane tasks and able to focus on human pursuits. Automation and augmentation in the home and workplace already save us time and the Opt-In Future is all about who we will become during the time saved.
