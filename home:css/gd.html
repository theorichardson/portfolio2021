				<p>I am a proficient systems thinker and I enjoy mapping out concepts, theories and the relationships between technologies and trends. These technologies often manifest as signals of upcoming trends. By maintaining this practice as new signals and trends arise, I hope to develop comprehensive maps of innovation and human behaviour.<br><br>
				The above maps are on Data as Material, "A Culture of Moments" (Alexander Manu, <i>Transforming Organizations for the Subscription Economy: Starting from Scratch</i> Routledge, 2017) and The Opt-In future.<br><br>
				Data as Material is the idea of data creation and collection serving as the basis of design and business activity today. Users produce and consume data which leads to the production and consumption of more data. This has reshaped business model design and creates new opprtunities for networks, services and experience optimization.<br><br>
				Data as Material produces a culture of moments. DaM reinvented conventional value propositions by putting the value delivery at the center of the experience. These new forms of value delivery are usually seamless and quick and they create ecosystems like the sharing and streaming economies and XaaS.</p>

			<div class="sectionRight">
				<p>I am the designer at Xesto, a University of Toronto accelerated computer vision startup. I designed the Xesto app and brand identity for the company, both of which launched in November 2020. The app harnesses the power of the FaceID camera in iPhones X and above to help users scan and size their feet for online shoe shopping.<br><br><strong>Constraint: </strong>The Xesto app relies on the FaceID camera in iPhones X and up for TrueDepth scanning. Therefore, a constraint baked into the app is that the scanning process takes place with the phone screen facing away from the user.<br><br>

					We started by testing 3 different scanning user interfaces with users who had never been exposed to the products before. We got strong feedback that the "target" method of lining the camera up with an image of a foot was far too difficult, though multiple users had suggested it at an earlier stage. We realized that while our first UI was too open ended, the target method was too restrictive.<br><br><strong>Opportunity: </strong>We asked "How can the app hold the user's hand throughout the scanning process?" and paid attention to how we would explain the scanning process when we intervened in unsuccessful user testing. This led us to the idea of a guided UI wherein Xesto checks in with the user throughout the scanning process.<br><br>

					<strong>Result: </strong>With the guided UI, approximately 80% of users took successful scans for the first time during our last round of testing. The key to this UI was pauses between each photograph that require the user's manual approval. "Does your photo look like this?" and a visual cue reduced error by a large margin.
